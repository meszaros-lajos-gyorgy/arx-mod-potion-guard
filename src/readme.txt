 Potion Guard mod for Arx Fatalis
----------------------------------

Imagine being in a tense combat situation, you're low on health and
you try to use the hotkeys to drink a health potion. But instead of
"H" (default hotkey for drinking health potion) you accidentally press
"G" (default hotkey for drinkin mana potion) and you waste a valuable
mana potion. This mod will override the default scripts of health and
mana potions so that if your stats are full you won't use up any of
those potions when drinking them.
